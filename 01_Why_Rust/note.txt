Why Rust?
- Enforces type-safety for variables and data.
- Provides access to underlying memory and assets as it is a very-low level language.
- Incredibly faster than other languages like JS, Python, etc.
- Rust do have a compiler which converts source code to binary and ultimately running the binary.
- Allows concurrency: running multiple threads simultaneously.
- Memory safe: concepts like owners, borrowing anf lifetimes which makes it extremely safe.
